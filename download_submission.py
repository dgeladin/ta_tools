r"""
Download student submission so that this can be tested by graders.

This is the front end tool to automate downloading student repos.
We read in the user input, parse it and call the back library correctly.

Execute this program with the -h for help or the two letter code for the
assignment to download it.

NOTE:
Correct UTC time is 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSÂ±HH:SS'
Python 2.X does not natively support timezones, %Z for datetime module.
There are external modules that exist but for the purpose of this project,
we will assume all times are fed in as UTC and time values from Git commits
are normalized correctly.

Do not forget about datetime's isoformat to get this result!

    Converts the parser input into a complete Python dictionary to call the

    Arguments:
      assignment_name:   (str) The two letter assignment code for submission.

      should_pull_repo_flag:   (boolean) This is an override specifying
      if we should download the repos from Git or not. By default this is None.
      Here are the possible options:

      None:  Default auto settings which is download repos for all individual
            assignments and the first part of a team assignment.

        True (or anything Truthy): Always download repos from Github.

        False (or anything Falsy but not None): Never download repos from
        Github.

      is_batch_run:   (boolean) States if this is a batch run. Prints are
        suppressed if they are.

    Returns:
      A dictionary with keys that can be used for the backside.
      The keys include:

      deadline:   (str) This is the deadline of the assignment if it is
        late. The input must be in strict ISO 8601 format
        'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'. As python 2 does NOT natively support
        different timezones, this must be in UTC timezone to be correctly
        comparable.

      assignment_name:   (str) This is the name of assignment that is
        used to store student submissions.

      is_team:  (boolean) This states if the submission is a team based or
        individual based one.

      report_filename:   (str) This is the name of the report that is
        generated. The output is sent to both stdout as well as this file.

      should_pull_repo_flag:   (boolean) This sets a flag if a repo should be
        pulled. Setting this to True does not guarantee it since we may
        cache the results.

      student_whitelist:   (list of str) This is the list of student username
